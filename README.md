# Code-Quiz

https://ntparker.github.io/Code-Quiz/

In this challenge I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a generic coding quiz with a 5 minute timer. For each incorrect answer, 10 seconds is deducted from the clock. Upon completion of the quiz, the user is informed of their score and whether theirs was a new highscore. The user is then able to input their initials to be displayed on the leaderboard using local storage. Finally, the user is provided the option to reload the quiz and try again.
